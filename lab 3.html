    <p>The New York Rangers are a team that I have followed since my oldest memory of the sport. I remember it clearly, it was the year 2012, the Rangers were playing against the Philidelphia Flyers in a  game called the winter classic. This happens every year where two teams are selected to play a game in a stadium outdoors. Since then, I have grown more passionately towards the sport. Typically when I was a kid I would pick up different sports, and stop playing them just as fast. But hockey was different. The fast pace of the games made me fall in love with the sport, and start to play it myself. Addisionally, Rangers hockey is an escape from reality. No matter what, I always know i have a game to watch every other night during the winter. The Rangers are a team that are considered a part of the "origional six". These are the very first teams that existed in the league, and often have the most stanley cups. The Rangers have four Stanley Cup Championships so far, with the most recent being won in 1994.</p>
