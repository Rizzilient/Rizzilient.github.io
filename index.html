    <h1>My name is Sean Rizzo</h1>
    <h2>I am a computer science major</h2>

    <p>I have been learning code/programming for the past four years. I started as a sophmore in high school. Since then I have been drawn to the subject eagar to learn more with each class that I take. I have learned languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Java, and C++ so far. Something that drew me to the subject was the money involved in the field, as well as my passion for technology. I am currently working for a Radiology company, and plan to work while taking classes to both build responsability and time management skills. </p>
    <p>Some of my interests are:</p>

        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Programming</li></i></b>
