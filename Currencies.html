    <p>The stock market is a global market that impacts everyone in every single nation. That being said, it is important that all of the worlds markets maintain a steady and positive growth, as well as being conpatible with the world. When the world is all investing in different stock markets, currencies are exchanged and nations gain capital, also growing their own currency systems. This is one of the most important reasons that the stock market currencies are important to the world, and the stocks themselves. </p>
